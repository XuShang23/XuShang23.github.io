I am currently a second year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California San Diego, 
working with Professor [https://zhengy09.github.io/index.html Yang Zheng]. \n

Previously, I was a master student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. 
I worked in Biped robotics lab with Professor [https://grizzle.robotics.umich.edu/ Jessy Grizzle]. \n

My research interests lie in control, optimization and learning. Specifically, I’m interested in constructing structured representation for 
nonlinear systems with high-dimensional measured data and develop efficient optimal control algorithm.
